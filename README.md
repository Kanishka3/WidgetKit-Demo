# WidgetKit-Demo

### Timeline Entry Relevance: Smart Stacks relevance 
Smart Stacks is a new feature on iOS 14 which shows relevant Widget according time and utility. 

Quoting from documentation: 

The range of the `scale` is entirely up to you and could be 1 to 100, 50 to 5000, or any other range of positive numbers that’s meaningful to you. WidgetKit calculates the relative difference of scores between entries, so the absolute values don’t matter.
